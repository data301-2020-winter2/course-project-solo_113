## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Chess is a common board game that is almost 1500 years old, yet has a tremendous amount of complexity that its simple exterior might not communicate. There are dozens, if not hundreds of unique gambits, defenses, and strategies that can be employed in games of chess to edge out a victory. The game at its core is a game of pattern recognition, which is a task computers excel at, making it an obvious choice for data analysis. 

As of late, the game has a experienced a renaissance of sorts on the internet, with chess tournaments on Twitch.tv bringing in tens of thousands of viewers and online chess sites like [Chess.com](https://chess.com) reaching levels of engagement never seen before. I've become quite a fan of these livestreams, yet I am an abysmal chess player. Analyzing a dataset of chess matches will help me to understand what factors matter most in winning a game of chess, and hopefully I will find insights into whether black or white is a better choice. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset I chose can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess). The dataset consists of the data from 20,000+ chess games played on Lichess.org, a website where visitors can play live games of chess with other users. The dataset contains the following information:
- Game ID: Lichess's ID for the game
- Rated (T/F): whether or not the game was rated 
- Start Time: timestamp of the state of the game
- End Time: timestamp of the end of the game
- Number of Turns: total number of turns during the game
- Victory Status: outcome of the game 
- Winner: can be black or white
- Time Increment: time of the match + if there is a time increment after a move
- White Player ID: player ID of white
- White Player Rating: rating of the white player
- Black Player ID: player ID for black
- Black Player Rating: rating of the black player
- All Moves in Standard Chess Notation: list of all moves in chess notation performed during the game
- Opening Eco: Standardised Code for any given opening
